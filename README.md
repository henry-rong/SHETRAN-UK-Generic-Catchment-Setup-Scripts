# SHETRAN-UK-Generic-Catchment-Setup-Scripts

This project contains the code required for setting up UK catchment models. These can be produced using ascii masks of a range of resolutions.
The project also includes functions that can be used to analyse the simulations. 
Simulations are set up from gridded historical climate data (CEH-GEAR and CHESS, 1980-2015) and static input data. 
These datasets are not included in this repository but code is included on how to build these. Code on how to build the soil map is not yet included, but will be in future iterations.
