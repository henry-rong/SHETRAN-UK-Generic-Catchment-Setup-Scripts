# SHETRAN-UK-Generic-Catchment-Setup-Scripts

## Description

This repository contains the code required for setting up UK catchment models. These can be produced using ASCII masks of a range of resolutions.
The project also includes functions that can be used to analyse the simulations. 
Simulations are set up from gridded historical climate data (CEH-GEAR and CHESS, 1980-2015) and static input data. 
These datasets are not included in this repository, but code is included on how to build these.
