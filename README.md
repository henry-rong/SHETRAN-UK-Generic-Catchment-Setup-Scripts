# SHETRAN-UK-Generic-Catchment-Setup-Scripts
This project contains the code required for setting up UK catchments. These can be produced using 1km ascii masks (aligned to the nearest 1000m). The project also includes functions that can be used to analysise the simulations. Simulations are set up from gridded historical climate data (CEH-GEAR and CHESS, 1980-2015) and static input data. These datasets are not included in this repository.
